* Control the ESP32 LED by pressing the button.

-This project shows a simple circuit using an ESP32 microcontroller. The LED lights up when the button is pressed. The code sets up the ESP32 to monitor the status of the button and control the LED.


This repository contains the code to implement a basic interaction between a button and an LED using the ESP32 microcontroller. The LED connected to pin lights up whenever the button connected to pin is pressed. This is a simple example to demonstrate digital input and output handling on the ESP32 platform.

* we need to :

1/ 1 LED lamp.

2/ Resistors.

3/ Connection board and connecting wires.

4/ 1 Push button.

5/ ESP32 board.
